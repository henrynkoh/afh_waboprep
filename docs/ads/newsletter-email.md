Hi,

If you’re converting a single-family home in **Lewis, Thurston, or Pierce County (WA)** into an **Adult Family Home (6 beds)**, you need to pass a **local Building Official inspection** before DSHS licensing.

**AFH WABO Prep** helps you do that in one flow:

1. **Entry Mode** — Enter property data (rooms, doors, windows, stairs, site). Export CSV/JSON.
2. **2D/3D Drawing** — Generate a floor plan and isometric from that data. Export SVG for your permit packet.
3. **Pipeline** — Use AI-agent prompts (Compliance, Design, Permit Ops, Red-Team) with Moltbot/Clawdbot or any AI runner.
4. **Centralia Packet** — Required submittal list and document names for City of Centralia and Lewis County.
5. **Curriculum & Top 100 Q&A** — 8-week consultant outline and WAC/DSHS 15-604 Q&A.

**Case study:** 2606 Cooks Hill Rd, Centralia 98531 — same flow for any address.

**Quick start:**
